<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Thermosensitive Hydrogel Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Negative Thermosensitive Hydrogel</li><li>Positive Thermosensitive Hydrogel</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The thermosensitive hydrogel market comprises two primary types: negative thermosensitive hydrogels and positive thermosensitive hydrogels. Negative thermosensitive hydrogels expand and swell upon cooling, becoming more hydrophilic and absorbing water, while contracting and losing water in warmer conditions. Conversely, positive thermosensitive hydrogels exhibit the opposite behavior, shrinking when cooling and swelling when heated, often becoming more hydrophobic. Each type has distinct applications in drug delivery, tissue engineering, and biomedical devices, tailored to leverage their unique thermal responses for specific therapeutic outcomes.</p></p>
