<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Small Scale LNG Terminals Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Liquefaction Terminals</li><li>Regasification Terminals</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The small-scale LNG terminals market consists of two primary types: liquefaction terminals and regasification terminals. Liquefaction terminals focus on converting natural gas into liquefied natural gas (LNG) for storage and transportation, often serving remote or smaller markets. Regasification terminals, on the other hand, revert LNG back into gaseous form for distribution and consumption, typically in areas with limited pipeline infrastructure. Both types play a crucial role in expanding access to natural gas and enhancing energy security in various regions.</p></p>
