<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Covid Testing Kit Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Nucleic Acid Testing</li><li>Antibody Testing</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Covid testing kit market encompasses various types, primarily nucleic acid testing (NAT) and antibody testing. Nucleic acid testing detects the presence of the virus's genetic material, typically through PCR tests, providing accurate results for active infections. Antibody testing, on the other hand, identifies antibodies in the blood, indicating past exposure to the virus. While NAT is crucial for diagnosing current infections, antibody testing helps assess immune response, making both types essential for managing public health and understanding Covid-19 dynamics.</p></p>
