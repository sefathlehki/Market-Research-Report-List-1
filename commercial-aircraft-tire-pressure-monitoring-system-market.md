<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Commercial Aircraft Tire Pressure Monitoring System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct TPMS</li><li>Indirect TPMS</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Commercial Aircraft Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) market consists of two main types: Direct TPMS and Indirect TPMS. Direct TPMS utilizes sensors mounted directly on the tire to measure real-time pressure and temperature, providing accurate data to the cockpit. In contrast, Indirect TPMS relies on the aircraft's existing wheel-speed sensors to estimate tire pressure based on differences in wheel rotation. Both systems enhance safety and efficiency by alerting pilots to potential tire issues before they escalate.</p></p>
