<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bioabsorbable Nail Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Plastics</li><li>Metal</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The bioabsorbable nail market is primarily categorized into two types: plastics and metals. Plastic bioabsorbable nails, often made from materials like polylactic acid (PLA) or polyglycolic acid (PGA), offer lightweight, corrosion-resistant options that gradually degrade in the body, minimizing the need for removal surgeries. In contrast, metal bioabsorbable nails, typically composed of magnesium alloys or other biocompatible metals, provide greater mechanical strength and stability, making them suitable for load-bearing applications while also resorbing naturally over time. Both types serve in orthopedic applications, promoting healing while reducing long-term implant complications.</p></p>
